NSObject+Rx
===========

If you're using [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), you've probably encountered the following code more than a few times.

```swift
class MyObject: Whatever {
	let disposeBag = DisposeBag()

	...
}
```

You're actually not the only one; it has been typed many, many times.

[![Search screenshot showing many, many results.](assets/screenshot.png)](https://github.com/search?q=let+disposeBag+%3D+DisposeBag%28%29&type=Code&utf8=âœ“)

Instead of adding a new property to every object, use this library to add it for you, to any subclass of `NSObject`. 

```swift
thing
  .bindTo(otherThing)
  .addDisposableTo(rx_disposeBag)
```

Sweet.

It'll work just like a property: when the instance is deinit'd, the `DisposeBag` gets disposed. It's also a read/write property, so you can use your own, too.

Installing
----------

This works with RxSwift version 2, which is still prerelease, so you've gotta be fancy with your podfile. 

```ruby
pod 'RxSwift', '~> 2.0.0-beta'
pod 'NSObject+Rx'
```

And that'll be ðŸ‘Œ
